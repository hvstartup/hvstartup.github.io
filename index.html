  <h1>HV Startup Communities</h1>
  <h2>About HV Startup</h2>
  <p>HV Startup is a community of influencers and catalysts, engineers and educators, designers and developers, manufacturers and entrepreneurs. The community is bound by two threads â€“ we all reside in the Hudson Valley and we are all committed to supporting economic development, innovation and entrepreneurial outcomes in our region.</p>
  <h2>Team</h2>
  <p>While HV Startup is defined by a broader community, we see value to a core set of leaders and committes that can be used to tackle specific challenges or create momentum around specific initiatives of interest. The initial leadership group consists of the following individuals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Human One</li>
    <li>Human Two</li>
    <li>Human Three</li>
  </ul>
